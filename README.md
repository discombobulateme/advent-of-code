**Advent of Code** is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) that can be solved in any programming language. There's **a puzzle** each day with **two parts**. For each part you resolve, you get **one star**. By the end of the 25th days, if you do all the 25 puzzles with both parts you get **50 stars**, which is the minimum to finish the advent.

Puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5. Getting a star first is worth 100 points, second is 99, and so on down to 1 point from the 100th place on.

## About this repository

This repository contains the [Advent of Code 2021 solutions](https://adventofcode.com/2021) I used to solve the puzzels.

Being a very beginner developer I relied on friends-of-the-internet help for all the puzzles. In each file I provide the link to the underlying code that I used to work through the problems. All solutions are in JavaScript. There is a Python code on day 23, extra.

I higly recommend everyone to do it. It is fun a a great way to collectivelly learn code.
Puzzles are fun, sometimes using interesting well know algorithms, and, as they are made
to any computer programming language, it it also great to compare code with different
languages, or trying to solve in one that is outside of your comfort zone.

## Find help

There is a subreddit called [Solutions Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/solution_megathreads) where people share their code. Doubts, visualizations and agonies are also shared in the [Advent of Code Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). Megathreads are not available in the same day, to keep a more honest leaderboard.

A good soul created a webapp called [Submissions r/adventofcode](https://aocweb.yulrizka.com/) to help find solutions on Solutions Megathread, where you can filter by day and language.

Someone called [Fish N Chips UK](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/advent-of-code-2021/list?title_no=713188) has created a graphic/comics style interpretation of each puzzle, which can be super helpfull too.

## Creating a private leaderboard

There is a general leaderboard that takes into account the running time since the puzzle was launched, but you can also create private leaderboards for you and your group of friends.
To create one you need to:

1. Go to [leaderboard/private](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private)
2. Once you're logged in, you should see something like
```
You have a private leaderboard that only you and its members can [View].
Others can join it using the code XXXXXXXXXX. Up to 200 users can join, including yourself.
```
3. Share the code so others can join
